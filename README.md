# OGC Building Block for GeoDCAT implemented using the OGC API Records baseline

This will define a JSON schema linked to GeoDCAT using JSON-LD contexts.  The schema will extend OGC-API-Records.

Building Blocks support validation of examples against both the JSON schema and the RDF (JSON-LD) and can be used to develop and test examples of target ontologies.

Transformations to related models can be supported in the automation pipeline.

Plan is to map to other metadata representations to support validation of a common content profile against multiple encodings.:
 * STAC
 * ISO 19115
