## GeoDCAT implementation using OGC API records JSON schema

This building block defines a binding from OGC API Records schema to the GeoDCAT profile of DCAT.

This profile extends a building block that uses the official JSON-LD context for DCAT bound to the OGC API Records.

That building block is expected to be stable, whilst the GeoDCAT profile is under development.
