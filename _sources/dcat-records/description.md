## GeoDCAT implementation using OGC API records JSON schema

This building block defines a binding from OGC API Records schema to the GeoDCAT profile of DCAT.

The JSON-LD context is derived from the published JSON-LD context constained within the JSON-LD expression of the DCAT vocabulary.

(Note that such a context should be provided as a reusable resource - if no changes are deemed necessary to implement an OGC API records schema then a _proxy_ building block for DCAT will be created to support re-use of this context.)
