## DCAT baseline bound to OGC API records schema

This building block defines a binding from OGC API Records schema to the DCAT Vocabulary.

The JSON-LD context is derived from the [JSON-LD context for DCAT-AP](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/context/dcat-ap.jsonld).

It uses the context for a dcat:Dataset as the basis for a Record.
