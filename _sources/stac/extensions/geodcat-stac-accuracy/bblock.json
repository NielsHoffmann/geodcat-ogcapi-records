  "abstract": "This profile binds the schema for the STAC Accuracy extension to a profile of GeoDCAT.  It inherits a common mapping of STAC and OGC API Records Item and Collection objects to the DCAT model. Additional terminology reequired for the semantics of the extension can be mapped to additional ontologies as required. (Note this is a work in progress, the building blocks provide a test harness for these mappings, allowing systematic development of a GeoDCAT core ontology to meet the requirements of these existing metadata schemas.",
